The data generated by program "data.txt" can be plotted in gnuplot by command below.
this command is eneterd in gnuplot commandline. 
	cd'' enter the absolute path to the folder containing the data.txt inside Apostrophes.
	set autoscale fix
	set xtics 1 //this number is the x axis incrementation
	set ytics 1 //this number is the y axis incrementation
	set palette rgb 21,22,23

	plot 'data.dat' with image notitle
the File "File1.900000.txt" contains iteration count, cpu time and L2Norm (error). 
It can be plotted by command
	cd'' enter the absolute path to the folder containing the File1.900000.txt inside Apostrophes.
For iteration count
	set xrange [0:700]
	set yrange [1e-6:50]
	set xlabel 'iteration'
	set ylabel 'L2 Norm'
	set key at screen 0.98,0.95
	plot 'File1.900000.txt'u 1:3 w lp ls 9 ti 'over-relaxation 1.90'
For cpu time
	set xrange [0:200000]//How log it took. this value is also printed in consoul.
	set yrange [1e-6:50]
	set xlabel 'cputime'
	set ylabel 'L2 Norm'
	set key at screen 0.98,0.95
	plot 'File1.900000.txt'u 2:3 w lp ls 9 ti 'over-relaxation 1.90'
